[0] James Fenimore Cooper
[1] Author's Introduction
[2] It is believed that the scene of this tale, and most of the information
[3] necessary to understand its allusions, are rendered sufficiently 
[4] obvious to the reader in the text itself, or in the accompanying notes.
[5] Still there is so much obscurity in the Indian traditions, and so much
[6] confusion in the Indian names, as to render some explanation useful.
[7] Few men exhibit greater diversity, or, if we may so express it, 
[8] greater antithesis of character, 
[9] than the native warrior of North America.
